11/4 Work

1. EpicOxygen, EpicInsulation, EpicMobility, & EpicJetpack Boosts have been removed. 
   -If you have one sell to a vendor for now. 
   -These may still appear in the loot table. 
2. Regular Insulation Boost | Old 50 Hot/25 Cold | New 75 Hot/ 50 Cold
3. EpicEVABoost gives major Jetpack buff
4. EpicMultiBoost now gives epic mobility buff
4. Added *WarBotBoostEpic* -Only drops off of the Warbot9000 25% chance. 
5. Reduced Suit Armor back to +50 of normal values. 
6. Added LightArmorEpic - Falls between light & meduim, unlockable in tech tree, Big mobility buff & fall damage mitigation. 

Several Values have been nerfed on Epic Boosters. Values for the Epic Boosters 
are now better buffed above their normal counterparts, but require a sacrafice
in armor and may not contribute volume capacity. Play with these trade offs and I 
believe you'll find the right balances for what comes your way, but never completely
OP...unless you acquire a *WarBotBoostEpic*.
