That was the name! @p4 Wait! @p3 They talked about a remote planet and a ship waiting somewhere for someone. @p5 Ah ... @w2 before I forget about it: One of them left behind a specially modified drill. I have it at my desk. @w5 I have no use for it, so you should have it, or return it to its owner.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
dialogue_WeOO4,"@d5 Great to hear! @w3 Relay my greetings when you meet them. @w2 \n\nEnjoy your root beer, my friend.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

dialogue_q8480,@d5 You seem to be surprised to speak to hovering smiley face in front of a terminal? @w4 I am afraid we need to have some ... @w3 security measures in place. \n\n@w3 That's why I'm speaking to you via this remote access terminal.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

dialogue_qmiW6,"@d5 ... @w2 I currently can't relay any of that information, I am afraid. @p6 ... @p4 But let's get started. @w4 The Zirax Scum are always on our heels and the AI protecting our little meeting is already detecting some cyber-espionage patterns trying to break in on our conversation.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
dialogue_4K84F,<i>I'm listening</i>,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
dialogue_uWCem,"@d5 First and foremost, I am .. @w2 your contact person, Sectioner32. @w4 On behalf of GLaD, the Galaxy Liberation and Defense organization, I would like to thank you for answering our call. @w6 You won't regret it. @w5 And it will make the galaxy a better place!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
dialogue_GaemS,<i>And that means?</i>,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
dialogue_iSeSW,"@d5 First, we would like to send you on a simple and well-paying mission: @w2 Go to a Polaris Mining Facility and investigate. @p5 Your suit AI has just being sent the mission package. @w5 It will be decrypted step by step and reveal all necessary info. @w5 \n\nPlease come back here, when the mission is completed.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

dialogue_mGi4C,@d5 Welcome! @w2 I hope you had a good flight! @w3 Those Zirax patrols are annoying. \n\n@w3 Hope you didn't have any trouble with them?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
dialogue_CWmqW,<i>No more than usual</i>,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
dialogue_SiS0W,"@d5 Ah, good. @w2 Well .. @w2 Headquarters said they would send an inspector sometime soon. @w5 But .. @w2 hm .. you must have been already underway, right?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

dialogue_8W8Qa,"@d5 Of course ... @w2 Ah ... @w2 Sorry ... @p4 Please excuse me, I'm a bit nervious. @w3 We are ALL a bit anxious over here, since we found that ... @w2 item ... @w2 down there. @w4 Of course, we didn't tell anyone outside this facility.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

dialogue_Wu08i,"@d5 Yes. Yes, of course! @p3 So the foreman of yesterday's shift reported that something strange has been found right when they broke the first rocks of this new promethium vein. @w7 He said it was some kind of a stick, wrapped in cloth and made from of a never-before-seen material. @p6 I first thought they were having a joke at my expense ... @w2 as usual ... @w2 but the first analysis indicated the item they found is extremely old and it seems to contain a power source. @p9 So, in order to to prevent disturbing something, I stopped all work on that mine and informed headquarters, following the new guidelines for reporting archeological discoveries. @p9 All of the crew, except the managers have been sent home for the time being.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

dialogue_a8Kau,"@d5 Of course! @w3 I am currently busy with writing this report anyway. @w5 It should be ready when you leave. @w4 \n\nMeanwhile, the station is at your disposal.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

dialogue_mei89,<i>Please report.</i>,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
dialogue_PiFKW,"@d5 First let me note, the mining operations on the PLANET have gone very well. @w6 I often feel like a REMNANT @w2 when I look at all those great people working on this project. @w7 You would be surprised, we often do not need to descend into the dark MINE @w2 to find interesting opportunities. @p9 If you ask me, each house needs some GUIDANCE, @w2 even if you need to handle it on a staff or on a STICK, @w2 before venturing to places where ANCIENT HISTORY is still breathing.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
dialogue_JiawW,<i>Join in the charade</i>,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
dialogue_GC0s6,"@d5 Inspector, of course you weren't sent here to listen to an old digger, right? @w4 If I were you, @w2 I would take the opportunity to @w2 go to our CELLAR @w2 and fetch some rare wine, but leave before the RATS come after you. @p9 Let me know when you are ready, so we can cheer with a SMILEY FACE, when you are back.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

dialogue_4CE88,"@d5 This is what remains of Mahan Station, of the glorious Zirax-Talon Assembly! @p6 Centuries passed, since this fragment of a once mesmerizing world was caught by the gravity of that yellow star. @w6 This part of the archive has survived the test of time, the war of silence, and the destruction of its home world, preserving the history and technology of the glorious past, for you or anyone else to make good use of it.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
dialogue_eKeiW,<i>How long..?</i>,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
dialogue_O3mix,"@d5 975 years, High Representative. @p4 It has been a long wait. @w4 The others, @w2 those that tried to rob all the data, @w2 destroyed much of the information that was perserved in this place @w6 before they fell victim to the infestations. @p6 This infection will not be destroyed by any passing of time. @w5 No explosion or weapon found in the past could stop it either. @w5 \n\nBut now you are here!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

dialogue_aWmmq,"@d5 I am afraid many parts of my data nodes are destroyed. @w4 And, @w2 possibly due to the removal of the contamination shields, @w2 the degradation of information continues.
