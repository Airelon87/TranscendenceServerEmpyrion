**Transcendence V177 B3718 Scenario Content Patch**

Thank you all for waiting and being patient with the wipe. 
Glacial has provided everyone a Living Ship. In order to claim it to prove your worthiness you must travel
to EventOrbitPVE by Haven teleporter and claim one for yourself. Make sure to blueprint! A big note yall may have noticed is that the title 
of the server now says "Public Test Server" instead of "Private". Its time to take on some new players and hopefully not wipe 
till v1.8 or v1.9  

**The Patch Notes**
*1. First Introduction of the Shield Bonus mechanic.* 
-Players can grow pentaxid and gold, add Capaciters, Perplexors, and other devices to enhance their sheild capacity and regen rate. 
-The Shield Generators themselves use much less energy while on or off, but as players grow their sheild system 
 energy usage will curve up whether the shield is off or on.
-Some devices also add ShieldCapacity bonuses such as Epic Detectors. 
-Base and CV shield generators are equal in Capacity, Recharge, and Energy. 
-Hover Vessels have not been added to this system yet.  
-The LegacyEnergyCore fuel tank and ZedZorgGenerator will help support a hardy shield system. 

*2. Galaxy Config*
-Legacy have been tamed down a lot. Their is more variety of peaceful planets and the addition of ZedZorg inhabited alien worlds. 
-Fixed typo where Barren playfields caused CoQ upon warping to new star.
-Added more factions to the outer galaxy zones for better POI spawning. 
-Removed Talon worlds using ConArt yamls. Talon ships still explore space in the outer galaxy scouting temperate planets.
-Fixed CoQ from wrong POI name syntax in some orbits.
-Moved Ocean planets to the Hot habitable zone for better spawn chances. 

*3. The ZedZorg are rampid in our Galaxy!*
-21 total POIs/Ships/Asteroids exist for this series concentrated in the outer galaxy. 
 Here players will find much need items such as LegacyEnergyCores to build powerful devices.
-AntiProton, Antimatter, and Ranger Turrets have been designed by semi-smart lab techs to help in
 the fight against the almighty ZedZorg. 
-The ZedZorg have left a mess of the fallen Zirax Federation ships that defended their homeworlds. 
 Those worlds are now glassed and settled by ZedZorg Platforms. An adventerous salvager's paradise perhaps? 

*4. Suits & Boosters*
-Normal suits can only have normal boosters. 
-Epic suits can only have epic boosters
-Transportation Boosters work with normal and epic suits. 

*5. Instances:*
-RipDatPow's new TunnelPortalInstance has been added to the server. Portal location is at Adelavine Commons. 
-All instances on the server now allow a temporary embargo on volume/weight thanks to physics defying technology. 
 This means while in an instance you can carry all you want. When you leave you must unload before you can add to your backpack. 
 There is a catch, ZedCity & ZedAsteroid now will NOT ALLOW ENTRY if you have anything in your backpack or toolbar.
